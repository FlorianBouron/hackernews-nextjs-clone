# HackerNews Clone

Project built using NextJS

# Motivation

Creating client-side rendered React apps is awesome. However, it isn't enough to just be able to create highly-interactive user interfaces. It is also important to start considering page loads especially when the app becomes big. Another consideration is SEO. Using server-side-rendering (SSR) should take care of these two matters.

There are ways to do SSR with React. However, NextJS makes it easy.

This HackerNews clone is my first big project using Next JS.
